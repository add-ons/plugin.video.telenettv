Please read the instructions below carefully.

### What does this plugin do? ###
This plugin makes it possible to watch live streams that are available on

# Disclaimer #
I do not own any of the listed content on this plugin. The content belongs to Telenet N.V.
All this plugin does is make simple HTTP requests to their servers to retrieve content
just like any browser like Chrome, Firefox etc. would do!

There is nothing illegal going on, as this plugin uses inputstream.adaptive to handle DRM content.
Like any browser the inputstream.adaptive plugin is using widevine to complete the transaction.

Without a valid Telenet subscription this plugin is useless for you!
